This information (“Customer Data”) is managed by your organization and is subject to our Data Processing Addendum.</p>

      <h2>7. AI Services Disclaimer (Hallucinations, Inaccuracy)</h2>
      <p>Balsam is not a healthcare provider, does not provide licensed therapy, counseling, diagnosis, or treatment. No medical or clinical relationship is created.

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BALSAM PROVIDES THE BALSAM APP AND BALSAM PLATFORM “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” BALSAM AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND CONTRACTORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, AVAILABILITY, SECURITY, ACCURACY, OR RELIABILITY. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE BALSAM APP OR BALSAM PLATFORM WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.</p>
      <p>BALSAM DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY MEDICAL, MENTAL HEALTH, OR LICENSED THERAPEUTIC ADVICE, RECOMMENDATIONS, OR DIAGNOSES. NOTHING STATED, POSTED, OR MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE BALSAM APP OR BALSAM PLATFORM IS INTENDED TO BE, AND MUST NOT BE TAKEN TO BE, THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE OR THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL CARE.</p>
      <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL BALSAM OR ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR CONTRACTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF YOUR DATA, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE BALSAM APP OR BALSAM PLATFORM, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
      <p>IN NO EVENT WILL BALSAM’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE BALSAM APP OR BALSAM PLATFORM EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (USD $100).</p>
      <p>YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS, DECISIONS, AND RELIANCE ON ANY OUTPUTS OR INFORMATION PROVIDED BY BALSAM. IF YOU ARE UNSURE WHAT TO DO IN ANY SITUATION, YOU SHOULD SEEK ADVICE FROM A QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL OR LICENSED PROVIDER.</p>
      <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain warranties or liabilities, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you in their entirety.</p>

      <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Balsam, its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, and contractors from and against any and all third-party suits, actions, claims, proceedings, damages, settlements, judgments, injuries, liabilities, obligations, losses, risks, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses) (“Claims”) arising out of or relating to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your use of the Balsam App or Balsam Platform;</li>
        <li>Any Inputs, Outputs, or content you submit, share, or generate through Balsam, including claims related to the accuracy, legality, or rights to such content;</li>

        <li>Your violation of any rights of any third party, including intellectual property, privacy, or publicity rights;</li>
        <li>Any gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud by you.</li>

      <h2>10. Termination and Suspension</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>You discuss or seek support for any of the Prohibited Topics listed in Section 4 above.</li>
        <li>Balsam determines, in its sole judgment, that your use of the service indicates you may require care from a licensed therapist, doctor, or emergency services.</li>
        <li>You violate these Terms, use Balsam in a way that could harm yourself, others, or the service, or if your account is used for fraud or illegal activity.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can stop using Balsam at any time by deleting your account or removing the Balsam App from your device. If you want to delete your account, your Inputs, or Outputs, or have questions about your data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@balsamapp.com">support@balsamapp.com</a>.</p>

      <h2>11. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</h2>
      <p>If you have a concern or dispute with Balsam, we encourage you to contact us first at <a href="mailto:support@balsamapp.com">support@balsamapp.com</a> so we can try to resolve the issue informally.</p>
      <p>If we can’t resolve the issue together, any dispute or claim relating to these Terms or your use of the Balsam App or Balsam Platform will be settled by binding arbitration, not in court. The arbitration will be handled by JAMS under its rules and will take place in Los Angeles, California, unless we both agree to a different location.</p>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law rules. If a court decides that any part of this section is not enforceable, the rest will still apply.</p>

      <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the updated Terms on the Balsam App and Balsam Platform, and may also notify you by email or in-app message if you have an account.</p>
      <p>If the changes are important, we will try to give you advance notice. By continuing to use the Balsam App or Balsam Platform after the new Terms are posted, you agree to the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you should stop using Balsam and delete your account.</p>

      <h2>13. Notices and Communications</h2>
      <p>If you have questions or need help, you can contact Balsam at <a href="mailto:support@balsamapp.com">support@balsamapp.com</a>. We may send you important updates or information about Balsam by email, in-app messages, or through the Balsam Platform. Please make sure your contact information is accurate and up to date so you don’t miss any important communications.</p>
      <p>If you need to contact us about your account, privacy, or these Terms, please email <a href="mailto:support@balsamapp.com">support@balsamapp.com</a>.</p>

      <h2>14. Miscellaneous</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not transfer or assign your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without Balsam’s written permission. Balsam may transfer its rights or obligations to another company if needed for a business reason (like a merger or sale).</li>
        <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the rest of the Terms will still apply.</li>
        <li><strong>No Waiver:</strong> If Balsam does not enforce a part of these Terms, it does not mean Balsam gives up the right to enforce it later.</li>
        <li><strong>Survival:</strong> Any part of these Terms that, by their nature, should continue after your use of Balsam ends will continue to apply.</li>
        <li><strong>No Third-Party Beneficiaries:</strong> These Terms are just between you and Balsam. No one else has any rights under these Terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For clarity, Balsam is not a healthcare provider, does not provide licensed therapy, counseling, diagnosis, or treatment. No medical or clinical relationship is created. Balsam is not a substitute for professional care. Nothing stated, posted, or made available through Balsam is intended to be, and must not be taken to be, the practice of medicine or the provision of medical care.</p>
